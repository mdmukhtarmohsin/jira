    Generate a comprehensive sprint retrospective based on the following data:

    ${JSON.stringify(completedTasks, null, 2)}

    Delayed Tasks (${delayedTasks?.length || 0}):
    ${JSON.stringify(delayedTasks, null, 2)}

    Blocked Tasks (${blockedTasks?.length || 0}):
    ${JSON.stringify(blockedTasks, null, 2)}

    Generate a retrospective in markdown format with the following structure:

    ## ðŸŸ¢ What went well
    - List positive outcomes and achievements
    - Focus on completed tasks and successful processes
    - Highlight team collaboration and efficiency wins
    - Note any process improvements that worked

    ## ðŸ”´ What didn't go well
    - List challenges and issues encountered
    - Include delays, blockers, and process problems
    - Identify patterns in task completion issues
    - Note communication or coordination problems

    ## ðŸ›  Action items for next sprint
    - Provide specific, actionable recommendations
    - Focus on process improvements and preventive measures
    - Suggest workload balancing if needed
    - Recommend tools or practices to adopt

    ## ðŸ“Š Sprint metrics
    - Completion rate: X% (completed tasks / total tasks)
    - Average task completion time
    - Story points delivered vs planned
    - Key performance indicators

    Keep it concise but insightful. Focus on actionable insights that can improve future sprints.
    Use data-driven observations and avoid generic advice.
