This demonstrates how retrospectives are now rendered with markdown formatting in both the AI Insights page and dashboard panel.

## üü¢ What went well

- **Team collaboration** was excellent throughout the sprint
- Successfully implemented **user authentication flow** with zero bugs
- Dashboard UI components were delivered **2 days ahead of schedule**
- Database schema migration completed successfully with **95% test coverage**
- Code review process was streamlined, reducing review time by 40%

## üî¥ What didn't go well

- API rate limiting implementation faced unexpected challenges
- Email notification system was **not started** due to blocked dependencies
- Documentation updates were delayed due to resource constraints
- Some team members were **overloaded** with tasks while others had capacity

### Key Issues Identified:

1. **Scope creep**: 3 additional features were added mid-sprint
2. **Communication gaps**: Daily standups missed critical blocking dependencies
3. **Resource allocation**: Uneven task distribution across team members

## üõ† Action items for next sprint

### High Priority Actions:
- [ ] **Redistribute workload** - balance tasks more evenly across team
- [ ] **Establish clear dependencies** before sprint start
- [ ] **Set scope freeze date** - no new features after day 3 of sprint

### Process Improvements:
- [ ] Implement **daily dependency check** in standups
- [ ] Create **documentation templates** to speed up docs writing
- [ ] Set up **automated testing** for API rate limiting features

### Tools & Practices:
- [ ] Adopt **pair programming** for complex features
- [ ] Use **time-boxing** for research tasks
- [ ] Implement **feature flags** for incremental rollouts
