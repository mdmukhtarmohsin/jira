## Features

### 1. Overview Tab

- **Key Metrics Summary**: Active alerts, sprint health, team velocity, and quality scores
- **AI-Generated Insights**: Real-time insights based on current project data
- **Visual Cards**: Easy-to-understand metric cards with trends

### 2. Scope Creep Detection

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Tracks story point increases during sprints
- **Risk Level Assessment**: Categorizes scope creep as low, medium, or high risk
- **Added Tasks Tracking**: Shows which tasks were added after sprint start
- **Alert System**: Warns when scope increases beyond threshold (15%+)

### 3. Risk Analysis

- **Team Member Overload**: Identifies team members with excessive workload
- **Delayed Tasks**: Tracks overdue tasks with risk assessment
- **Blocked Tasks**: Monitors tasks without assignees or dependencies
- **AI Recommendations**: Provides actionable suggestions to mitigate risks

### 4. Performance Metrics

- **Sprint Velocity Trends**: Planned vs completed story points over time
- **Team Productivity**: Individual member performance and efficiency
- **Quality Metrics**: Bug rates, rework percentage, customer satisfaction
- **Visual Progress Bars**: Easy-to-read progress indicators

### 5. Predictive Analytics

- **Sprint Completion Probability**: AI prediction for current sprint success
- **Burndown Prediction**: Forecasted vs actual progress
- **Risk Factors**: Identified factors that could impact sprint completion
- **Recommended Actions**: AI-suggested improvements

### 6. Retrospectives

- **Automated Generation**: AI-generated retrospectives for completed sprints
- **Historical View**: Access to past retrospectives
- **Content Analysis**: Structured feedback and insights
